# Transformations

We now know how to create objects, color them and/or give them a detailed appearance using textures, but they're still not that interesting since they're all static objects. We could try and make them move by changing their vertices and re-configuring their buffers each frame, but that's cumbersome and costs quite some processing power. There are much better ways to transform an object and that's by using (multiple) matrix objects. This doesn't mean we're going to talk about kungfu and a large digital artificial world.

Matrices are very powerful mathematical constructs that seem scary at first, but once you'll grow accustomed to them they'll prove extremely useful. When discussing matrices, we'll have to make a small dive into some mathematics and for the more mathematically inclined readers I'll post additional resources for further reading.

However, to fully understand transformations we first have to delve a bit deeper into vectors before discussing matrices. The focus of this chapter is to give you a basic mathematical background in topics we will require later on. If the subjects are difficult, try to understand them as much as you can and come back to this page later to review the concepts whenever you need them.

## Vectors

In its most basic definition, vectors are directions and nothing more. A vector has a direction and a magnitude (also known as its strength or length). You can think of vectors like directions on a treasure map: 'go left 10 steps, now go north 3 steps and go right 5 steps'; here 'left' is the direction and '10 steps' is the magnitude of the vector. The directions for the treasure map thus contains 3 vectors. Vectors can have any dimension, but we usually work with dimensions of 2 to 4. If a vector has 2 dimensions it represents a direction on a plane (think of 2D graphs) and when it has 3 dimensions it can represent any direction in a 3D world.

Below you'll see 3 vectors where each vector is represented with (x,y) as arrows in a 2D graph. Because it is more intuitive to display vectors in 2D (than in 3D) you can think of the 2D vectors as 3D vectors with a z coordinate of 0. Since vectors represent directions, the origin of the vector does not change its value. In the graph below we can see that the vectors **v**
and **w** are equal even though their origin is different:

When describing vectors mathematicians generally prefer to describe vectors as character symbols with a little bar over their head like Ë‰v. Also, when displaying vectors in formulas they are generally displayed as follows:
